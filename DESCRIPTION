Description: A workflow is a combination of a model and preprocessors (e.g, a 
    formula, recipe, etc.) (Kuhn and Silge (2021) <https://www.tmwr.org/>). In 
    order to try different combinations of these, an object can be created that 
    contains many workflows. There are functions to create workflows en masse 
    as well as training them and visualizing the results.
