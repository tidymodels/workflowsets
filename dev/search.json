Let’s create basic recipe build : enact correlation filter, additional step used: Similarly, PCA: might want assess different models, including regularized method (glmnet): Rather creating 9 combinations preprocessors models, can create workflow set: doesn’t make sense use PCA filter glmnet model. can remove easily: models tuning parameters. resolve , ’ll need resampling set. case, time-series resampling method used: ’ll use simple grid search models running workflow_map(). execute resampling tuning function workflows workflow column: results column contains results call tune_grid() workflows. autoplot() method shows rankings workflows:  best workflow:  can determine well combination looking best results per workflow:","code":"library(tidymodels) library(workflowsets) data(Chicago) #
