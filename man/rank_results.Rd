\title{Rank the results by a metric}
\usage{
rank_results(x, rank_metric = NULL, select_best = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A workflow set that has all results.}

\item{rank_metric}{A character string for a metric.}

\item{select_best}{A logical; should the results only contain the numerically
best submodel per workflow.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns: \code{wflow_id}, \code{.config}, \code{.metric}, \code{mean},
\code{std_err}, \code{n}, \code{preprocessor}, \code{model}, and \code{rank}.
}
\description{
This function sorts the results by a specific performance metric.
}
\details{
If some models have the exact same performance,
\code{rank(value, ties.method = "random")} is used (with a reproducible seed) so
that all ranks are integers.

No columns are returned for the tuning parameters since they are likely to
be different (or not exist) for some models. The \code{wflow_id} and \code{.config}
columns can be used to determine the corresponding parameter values.

\examples{
chi_features_res

rank_results(chi_features_res)
rank_results(chi_features_res, select_best = TRUE)
rank_results(chi_features_res, rank_metric = "rsq")
