# workflowsets (development version)

* Fixed an `autoplot()` bug where, if one metric is selected but a ranking metric is not specified, the wrong metric is used to order the workflows (#52)

# workflowsets 0.0.2

* Ensured that `workflow_map()` does not fail if there are missing packages or if the function being mapped fails. 

# workflowsets 0.0.1

* First CRAN version
