# workflowsets 0.1.0

* Fixed an `autoplot()` bug where, if one metric is selected but a ranking metric is not specified, the wrong metric is used to order the workflows (#52)

* Updated pillar formatting for options objects. 

* New `extract_*()` functions have been added that supersede the existing `pull_*()` functions. This is part of a larger move across the tidymodels packages towards a family of generic `extract_*()` functions. The `pull_*()` functions have been soft-deprecated, and will eventually be removed

# workflowsets 0.0.2

* Ensured that `workflow_map()` does not fail if there are missing packages or if the function being mapped fails. 

# workflowsets 0.0.1

* First CRAN version
